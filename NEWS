* Version 0.16β
** Copyright assignment to the FSF.

* Version 0.15β
** Killing the archive buffer now also kills all subordinates.
** More work on meeting ELPA conventions.
*** cpio.el is now cpio-mode.el
*** removed cpio-mode-pkg.el


* Version 0.14β
** Since this is beta code, the archive file is backed up.
The backup file has a timestamp.
Since this is really only for beta code,
the backup is not intelligent in any way.

* Version 0.13̱β
** Clean up for publication to elpa.

* Version 0.12β
** Initial beta release.

* Version 0.11
** Fixed a destructive-looking bug in cpio-affiliated-buffers.el.
** Post-development cleaning up.

* Version 0.10
** Finds an appropriate major mode for an entry's contents.
   It does this with (set-auto-mode).
   So only entries for which (set-auto-mode) finds a mode get
   a non-trivial mode.
** New dired-like commands:
    + cpio-entry-contents-revert-buffer (no key mapping)
    + cpio-dired-do-touch ("T")
** You can now edit and save an entry's contents.

* Version 0.09
** There's now a find-file-hook
   and documentation on how to use/invoke cpio-mode.
** Changing owner or group no longer removes marks
   on the entries on which the change is being performed.
** cpio-affiliated-buffers.el has had some fixes.
   There were lots of issues around the kill-buffer-hook.
   It seems correct now.
   (Of course, bug reports are welcome.)
   Affiliated buffer tests have been fleshed out some.
** Byte compilation is cleaner.
   Not entirely clean, but cleaner.
** Some tests have had minor fixes.

* Version 0.08
** Binary format support.
   As with the ODC format, hpbin = bin if the archive contains no devices,
   and cpio-mode doesn't handle devices yet.

* Version 0.07
** Fontification (from dired).
** Dired-like commands:
   + cpio-dired-flag-backup-entries ("~")

* Version 0.06
** Support for the ODC archive format.
   Note that hpodc = odc if the archive contains no devices,
   and cpio-mode doesn't handle devices yet.
   (And it may never.)

* Version 0.05
** Support for the CRC archive format.

* Version 0.04
** Some post-development clean-up.

* Version 0.03
** More dired-like commands:
   + cpio-dired-flag-garbage-entries ("%&")
   + cpio-dired-goto-entry ("j")
   + cpio-dired-mark-executables ("**")
   + cpio-dired-mark-subdir-entries ("*s")
   + cpio-dired-mark-symlinks ("*@")
** Fixes to saving an archive.
** Fixes to cpio-dired-do-chgrp/own/mod.
** Automated test updates:
*** Automated tests now also check the catalog.
*** Automated tests that modify the catalog
    now confirm that the archive can be unpacked by cpio(1)
    after saving.
*** Automated tests all pass.

* Version 0.02
** You can now save an archive.
** More dired-like commands:
   + cpio-dired-add-entry ("I")
   + cpio-dired-display-entry ("f")
   + cpio-dired-do-chgrp ("G")
   + cpio-dired-do-chown ("O")

   + cpio-dired-extract-all ("Xa")
   + cpio-dired-extract-entries ("Xm")
   + cpio-dired-view-archive ("C-cC-c")
   + cpio-view-dired-style-buffer  ("C-cC-c" -- from archive buffer).
** You can now edit and save entry contents.
** Some automated testing of the dired-like interface.

* Version 0.01
** Basic function of cpio-mode, cpio-dired-mode, and
   cpio-contents-entry-mode are in place.
** You can extract selected entries (M-x cpio-dired-extract-entries),
   or extract all entries (M-x cpio-dired-extract-all).
** You can view an entry's contents and even edit the contents' buffer.
   However, you cannot save it yet.
** cpio-dired-mode has the following implemented commands:
   + cpio-dired-display-entry ("C-o")
   + cpio-dired-extract-all ("X a")
   + cpio-dired-extract-entries ("X m")
   + cpio-dired-find-entry ("f", "e", "C-j")
