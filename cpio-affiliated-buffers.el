;;; Commentary:

;; To keep track of which buffers are connected to a specific archive,
;; cpio-mode uses the idea of affiliated buffers.
;; 
;; The buffers affiliated with an archive's buffer are the following:
;; 1. The buffer holding the dired-like information.
;; 2. The buffers holding any entry's contents.
;; Killing [deregistering] the dired-like buffer also kills the archive's buffer,
;; and killing the archive's buffer kills
;; all remaining affiliated buffers.
;; 

;;; Documentation:

;; Two variables hold the relationships among buffers:
;; • *cab-subordinates* -- a list of the buffers immediately subordinate
;;   to the current buffer.
;; • *cab-parent* -- a buffer, the buffer to which the current buffer is affiliated.
;; Both variables are buffer local.
;; 
;; The existence of a subordinate buffer depends
;; on the the existence of its parent.
;; One consequence is that a subordinate buffer can have only one parent.
;; Another is that killing the parent buffer kills all subordinates as well.
;; Should a subordinate buffer have further subordinates,
;; then they must also be killed.

;; API:
;; (cab-register (buffer parent))
;;     Register BUFFER as a subordinate of PARENT.
;; (cab-registered-p (buffer parent)
;;     Return non-NIL if BUFFER is a registered subordinate of PARENT.
;; (cab-kill-buffer-hook)
;;     A hook for subordinate buffers that removes their registry entry 
;;     with PARENT.
;; (cab-deregister (&optional buffer))
;;     Kill BUFFER and its subordinates.
;;     Deregister BUFFER with its parent.
;; (cab-simple-deregister (buffer))
;;     The internal function for (cab-deregister).
;;     Don't use this directly.
;; (cab-clean)
;;     A temporary function for development
;;     that should more forcefully enforce the intent of (cab-deregister).

;; The following incantation should run the tests well.
;; emacs -batch -l ert -l cab-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
